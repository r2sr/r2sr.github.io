  - The address is 2150 Colorado Avenue, Boulder, CO.
  - You can park at the Folsom garage parking lot: parking is $2/hour.
  - The venue is at the "champions center" (there is a large sign that you cannot miss!). Rooftop terrace is at the top floor. [See annotated Google map link here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1C-ttnvnqRsMN4Ln0-b8e68wgaQRHdIk&usp=sharing).

## Travel from Airport to Boulder
Denver International Airport (DIA) is about 45 miles to Boulder.   There are many options to travel from the airport to Boulder.

  - **RTD Skyride AB bus:** [Westbound Airport -> Boulder](https://app.rtd-denver.com/route/AB/schedule?serviceType=2&direction=Westbound&branch=) and [Eastbound Boulder -> Airport](https://app.rtd-denver.com/route/AB/schedule?serviceType=3&direction=Eastbound&branch=). This bus runs approximately each hour from Denver International Airport  (follow signs to Denver Airport Station) to Boulder downtown bus terminus with very few stops in between. The bus costs $10.50 each way and has been very reliable (even when road conditions are poor). You can pay while boarding the bus but you will need to have the exact fare in cash.
     - The bus is a very convenient option if you are able to do so (i.e, have the time and do not mind waiting for the bus, etc.).
     - If you choose this option, we recommend taking the bus all the way to downtown Boulder station.
     - Take a uber/lyft from downtown Boulder station to your hotel (it should normally cost no more than 10-15 dollars).
  - **Shared ride shuttles** operate from Denver airport. You will find their counters inside the main terminal. There are a couple of shuttle services to Boulder that will leave every hour. These will typically take you right to your hotel (if you are staying at one of the larger places in town). You will need to pay for the shuttle inside the terminal and they will guide you to the pickup point for the ride.
    - Shared ride shuttles are more expensive but also convenient.
    - Please ensure that they will drop you off at or near your hotel.
    - Many local hotels are served by local shared ride companies. You can book your shuttle back to the airport at the hotel.
  - **Taxi/Uber/Lyft**:  Taxi will cost about \$120 from Denver to Boulder, one way. Lyft/Uber depends on the time of day and other conditions but will cost about \$80.
  - **Renting a Car:** There is a toll route (E-470) from airport to Boulder that can get you to the campus within 45 minutes under almost all times of the day. The toll will be about $15. The no toll route along I-70 and US-36 can take anywhere from 45 minutes to 1 hour 15 minutes depending on weather and traffic conditions.
