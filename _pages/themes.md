## Motivation

Modern science relies intimately on the use of automation in the form of
sophisticated instruments for data-acquisition; sophisticated models
of natural processes in physics, chemistry and biology; and advanced statistical
inference algorithms with the heavy use of software (both off-the-shelf and
custom built) to automate many of the critical steps in scientific workflows. At
the same time, we live in an era where the need for rigorous science is
paramount. Scientific breakthroughs enable technological advances such as
vaccines, cures for diseases, revolutions in agriculture, short-term and
long-term weather predictions, energy storage and faster computers. These
breakthroughs also drive billions of dollars of investment from governments and
private industry.

Recently the popular press has reported numerous instances of important and
high-profile scientific findings being retracted (see [retraction
watch](https://retractionwatch.com/)). Setting aside  cases of fraud or scientific misconduct, the key reasons for these retractions include unreliable data,
incorrect data processing (including inappropriate omission of data) and errors
in the analysis. Also these retractions often happen many years after
the publication of the initial article.

However, the evaluation of scientific discoveries consists of peer review of a
manuscript that is often missing many of the details such as the raw data and
the software for processing, analysis and visualization of this data.
Furthermore, peer reviewers often lack the necessary time and resources to
properly scrutinize these artifact even if they are available. Errors and
omissions are often overlooked during peer review, and thus challenge the
validity of the final conclusions. Reproducibility is an important related issue that
concerns external replication of the results by an independent third party.
Although reproducibility and correctness are related, we note that reproducible
research may not necessarily be correct but lends itself to judgement by
independent third parties

# Workshop Themes

The main theme of this workshop is to bring together scientists in a few chosen scientific areas
(climate science, biology, quantum computing and material science) with experts in chosen
areas of computer science including _data science_, _mathematics_, _statistics_ and _formal methods_. The latter area details
specifically  with the problem of specifying and validating the correctness complex
hardware, software, and cyber-physical systems.

The key objectives are to jointly explore ideas and establish collaborations around  the following themes:
  a) Rendering the process of scientific reasoning more rigorous by enabling others to check the key steps in the reasoning process including data acquisition, data processing, analysis and visualization that lead  to the scientific conclusions.   
  b) Exploring the use of automation in the form of formal logic to specify the key steps and automated reasoning tools such as theorem provers to verify them.

# Participants

Participation in this workshop is by _invitation only_. The workshop will involve experts and stakeholders from various communities including
  - Scientists from carefully chosen areas who are central to this enterprise.
  - Computer scientists, mathematicians, and logicians who specialize in theorem proving in general or automated reasoning as applied to software, hardware and cyber-physical systems.
  - Data scientists and statisticians who focus on statistical reasoning and its applications to
  science.
  - Representatives from funding agencies, scientific foundations and editors from key journals.


# Workshop Format

The  workshop will be held in-person in Boulder, CO. It will feature a small set of "theme-setting"
presentation by selected participants followed by in-depth discussions and reporting on the
themes mentioned above.

# Code of Conduct

Although the Association for Computer Machinery (ACM), an important organization of computer science researchers, professionals and educators is not involved in this workshop, we will subscribe to its
code of conduct.  We refer all participants to the full [code of conduct](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment).
