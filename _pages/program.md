## Theme Setting Presentations

These presentations will be 15 minutes each, focussing broadly on the challenges
of doing scientific research in a rigorous and reproducible manner, identifying
possible solutions both near term and longer term, and thinking about
opportunities for applying formal methods and related techniques.


### 10:30 AM - Natarajan Shankar (SRI)

 > Title/Abstract: TBA. 

### 10:45 AM - Jeremy Avigad (CMU)

> Title: Where the money is
>
> Abstract: 
> As the story goes, when a reporter asked bank robber Willie Sutton was asked why
> he robbed banks, he replied, "because that's where the money is." Formal 
> verification is difficult, and when faced with the question as to why we should 
> bother to verify a piece of software, the only reasonable answer is "because that's where the problems are."
> In this talk, I will discuss some examples of mathematical and scientific software where verification matters
> and where proof assistant technology can help ensure that the results are reliable.


#### 11:00 AM - Karthik Duraisamy (Michigan)

> Title: Challenges and Opportunities in Rigorous End-to-end Verification and Validation for Scientific Computing.



#### 11:15 AM - Jean Peccoud (Colorado State University)

> Title: What is a reproducible result? 
> 
> Abstract: A naïve understanding of reproducibility assumes that reproducible results are data with a variance of 0. Every experimental data has some experimental error and uncontrolled sources of variation. Therefore, reproducibility must be associated with a higher level of abstraction where different datasets lead to the same conclusions with a certain confidence level. In order to support this type of analysis, it is necessary to properly manage data before starting the data collection.


#### 11:30 AM - Borzoo Bonakdarpour (Michigan State University)

> Title: Identifying Casual Structures by Automated Reasoning
>
> Abstract: Scientific investigations have two purposes: (1) discovering previously unknown associations between a natural phenomenon (e.g., individuals infected with the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) often experience memory loss), and (2) generating precise mechanistic explanations for how the phenomena are causally related (e.g., a combination of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors that affect the formation of amyloid beta and tau proteins in the brain tissue). Among these two purposes, explanation is the most critical to achieve global impact; identifying the major root-causes of natural phenomena not only enables scientists to predict their future outcomes, but also implies the means in which we prevent or mitigate such events. In this talk, I will describe a framework for formalizing the notion causality based on the definition of Actual Causality by Halpern and Pearl. I will also explain how decision procedures such as SMT solving are capable of extracting causal structures in different areas of natural and social sciences.

#### 11:45 AM - Vijay Ganesh (Georgia Tech)

> Title/Abstract TBA.



## Discussion Topics

We will have a detailed set of discussion topics to be discussed. For convenience, we have broken down the topics into overlapping discussion themes.

**Note:**  these are quite preliminary and will likely change over the next few weeks.

  - **The Scientific Research Process** Describe typical project workflow in your area at a relevant level of detail.
     - How do you (or scientists in your area) typically acquire data?
        - How do you assess data reliability.
     - How do you process data?
     - What kind of software do you use? How do you validate this software?
     - How is the data processing described in your papers? Are there community-wide standards of what is acceptable?  Are they specified somewhere?
     - What is the typical state of reproducibility of scientific findings in your area?
        - Is reproducibility valued in your community? Do members of your community take time to reproduce other people's works?
  - **Specifying, Validating and Reproducing Scientific Discoveries:** Describe what your research/related work in formal methods can do to promote reproducibility.
     - What kind of specification formalisms can we bring about?
        - What aspects of data processing do these specification formalisms address?
        - Can these specifications encode how to reach conclusions from data?
     - What is the role of modeling when it comes to scientific workflows?
     - What sort of correctness properties can be analyzed by existing techniques?
     - How do we make existing techniques more usable to scientists?
     - Are there areas where your research can make some immediate impact in terms of enhancing scientific rigor/reproducibility?
  - **Rethinking Modern Peer-Review and Publication Processes:**  How can we enhance scientific publication process in the modern age?
    - What are the peer-review standards in your area?
       - How do peer reviewers approach supplementary materials/software?
       - Is reproducibility part of the peer review process?
    - How should publication process and journals  in your area respond to the challenges of reproducing scientific research?
      - What changes would be useful?
      - Are there journals that are making these changes? (point us to examples).
  - **Further discussion topics**
    - Promising approaches that are applicable to specific scientific areas.
    

## Discussion Organization

We will describe how the discussion will be organized to allow all participants to rotate through all the discussion themes over the workshop duration. We will also designate leaders and have volunteers who will take notes during these discussions.
