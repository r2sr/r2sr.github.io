## Theme Setting Presentations

These presentations will be 15 minutes each, focussing broadly on the challenges of doing scientific research in a rigorous and reproducible manner, identifying possible solutions both near term and longer term, and thinking about opportunities for applying formal methods and related techniques.

 **Detailed Program TBA**

## Discussion Topics

We will have a detailed set of discussion topics to be discussed. For convenience, we have broken down the topics into overlapping discussion themes.

**Note:**  these are quite preliminary and will likely change over the next few weeks.

  - **The Scientific Research Process** Describe typical project workflow in your area at a relevant level of detail.
     - How do you (or scientists in your area) typically acquire data?
        - How do you assess data reliability.
     - How do you process data?
     - What kind of software do you use? How do you validate this software?
     - How is the data processing described in your papers? Are there community-wide standards of what is acceptable?  Are they specified somewhere?
     - What is the typical state of reproducibility of scientific findings in your area?
        - Is reproducibility valued in your community? Do members of your community take time to reproduce other people's works?
  - **Specifying, Validating and Reproducing Scientific Discoveries:** Describe what your research/related work in formal methods can do to promote reproducibility.
     - What kind of specification formalisms can we bring about?
        - What aspects of data processing do these specification formalisms address?
        - Can these specifications encode how to reach conclusions from data?
     - What is the role of modeling when it comes to scientific workflows?
     - What sort of correctness properties can be analyzed by existing techniques?
     - How do we make existing techniques more usable to scientists?
     - Are there areas where your research can make some immediate impact in terms of enhancing scientific rigor/reproducibility?
  - **Rethinking Modern Peer-Review and Publication Processes:**  How can we enhance scientific publication process in the modern age?
    - What are the peer-review standards in your area?
       - How do peer reviewers approach supplementary materials/software?
       - Is reproducibility part of the peer review process?
    - How should publication process and journals  in your area respond to the challenges of reproducing scientific research?
      - What changes would be useful?
      - Are there journals that are making these changes? (point us to examples).

## Discussion Organization

We will describe how the discussion will be organized to allow all participants to rotate through all the discussion themes over the workshop duration. We will also designate leaders and have volunteers who will take notes during these discussions.
