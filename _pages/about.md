## About

R2SR 2023 is an invitation-only workshop sponsored by the US National Science Foundation.
The workshop will bring together _scientists_ at the forefront of various disciplines with
a primary focus on biological sciences, climate science and quantum physics with _computer scientists_
and _logicians_ who work on the problem of reasoning about the correctness of software
systems in order to understand whether the process of rigorous specification, verification
and validation can be used to promote rigor and reproducibility in various domains of science, especially where the “game changing” advances of the next two decades are expected.

## Logistics

The workshop will be held in-person on campus at the University of Colorado Boulder on November 13-14, 2023. It will feature a few presentations from various participants followed by discussions.
  - November 13th: the workshop will go all day from 9 AM - 5 PM with breaks.
