**Announcements**

 - Workshop will be happening in Boulder, CO on Nov 13, 2023 (Monday, full day) and Nov 14, 2023 (Tuesday, half day).

## About

R2SR 2023 is an invitation-only workshop sponsored by the US National Science
Foundation. The workshop will bring together researchers at the forefront of
various disciplines with a primary focus on biological sciences, climate
science, mathematics and quantum physics with computer scientists, data
scientists, mathematicians, statisticians and logicians who work on the problem
of reasoning about the correctness and reproducibility. The main goal is to
understand whether the process of rigorous specification and argumentation using
proofs can promote rigor and reproducibility in various domains of science,
especially where the “game changing” advances of the next two decades are
expected.

workshop themes.

## Logistics

The workshop will be held in-person on campus at the University of Colorado Boulder on November 13-14, 2023. It will feature a few presentations from various participants followed by discussions.

### Hotel

We have a blocked a limited number of rooms at a special rate for the nights at the Hilton Garden Inn/Embassy Suites near CU Boulder campus. Guests can book through the [link](https://www.hilton.com/en/attend-my-event/cu-dept-of-computer-science/) or they can call the hotel directly (phone numbers obtained by clicking the link). Please email Sriram directly if you  have any questions or want any adjustments. 

The “cut-off date” for accepting reservations into this room block is Friday, October 27, 2023. Reservations requests received
after 5:00 p.m. local time at the Hotel on the cut-off date will be accepted at the Hotel’s prevailing rate, based on room type
availability. Failure to reserve rooms before the cut-off date will not affect the enforceability of the attrition or cancellation
clauses.  If necessary, rooms must be canceled with a cancellation number obtained by 6 pm two days prior to arrival to avoid a
cancellation fee (one night’s room rate + tax). If the reservation is not canceled and the guest fails to arrive as scheduled, a no-show fee will be applied (one night’s room rate plus tax). 


#### Travel

The workshop will be held on the University of Colorado Boulder campus. Denver, CO is the closest city and the closest international airport is the Denver International Airport (code DIA). There are many options for getting from Denver to Boulder (approximately 40 miles). We will have more information on travel options here.
